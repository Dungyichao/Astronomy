# Astronomy
In this tutorial, we will provide basic theory of telescope and astronomy.

# 1. How to Choose Telescope
Some basic terminology is quite important when choosing among telescope: Aperture, Focal Length, Focal ratio (focal length devided by aperture). 
* Larger aperture can let you see more fainter object (collect more light). 
* Longer focal length can make object looks bigger (and more detail), however, the field of view will be smaller.
